- Currently p6-GStreamer is VERY vulnerable to ABI changes as mentioned in
  #<007e6cb6e9be21c74a9d99df4895166825391f2a>. Unfortunately, there is no
  real mechanism to handle such changes, especially if the plan is to support
  a wide range of versions.

  Such a mechanism should be designed. One thought is to abandon the use
  of non-public CStructs and go back to pointers. This would require a
  C-based helper library, to provide private structure sizes in the case
  where those private structures are to be used in a ::TypedBuffer.

- When late binding, attempt to detect the Failure object and emit a helpful
  message. see GStreamer::Bus for an example.

- Write a function to check for the proper libs. GStreamer being a suite,
  this could help in curbing errors when this is released.
