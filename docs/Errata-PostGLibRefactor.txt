t/04-playing-speed.t -- PASS: Playback direction do not work, but this
                              behavior is also exhibited in the reference
                              implementation. See c-helpers/02-playing-speed.c.
                              Also, the reference implementation has a bug
                              with setting playback speed, which the Raku
                              implementation does not.
