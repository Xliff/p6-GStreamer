At the time of this writing, 10-player.t is working. However there are still a
few outstanding issues:

   - There are quite a few places where undefined values are printed
   - A GLib warning is being issueed when attempting to play certain anime.
     This was encountered using
     /media/cbwood/Content/Torrents/\[HorribleSubs\]\ Darwin\'s\ Game\ -\ 01\ \[1080p\].mkv

I think it may be in the best interest to try and create isolated cases of this in order
to track down the problem, and then apply fixes to the actual 10-player.t file.

Given this, I think it is fine to merge these changes back into master.
